#### [ g _ 1 4 5 ]

black faces pressed against the glass 
where rain has pressed it's weight 
wind blown scarves in top down cars 
all share one western trait 
 
sadness leaks through tear-stained cheeks 
from winos to dime-store jews 
probably don't know they give me 
these late john garfield blues 
 
midnight fell on franklin street 
and the lamppost bulbs were broke 
for the life of me, i could not see 
but i heard a brand new joke 
 
two men were standing upon a bridge 
one jumped and screamed you lose 
and just left the odd man holding 
those late john garfield blues 
 
an old man sleeps with his conscience at night 
young kids sleep with their dreams 
while the mentally ill sit perfectly still 
and live through life's in-betweens 

i'm going away to the last resort 
in a week or two, real soon 
where the fish don't bite but once a night 
by the cold light of the moon 
  
the horses scream the nightmares dream 
and the dead men all wear shoes 
'cause everybody's dancin' 
those late john garfield blues

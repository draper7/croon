#### [ d _ 1 4 5 ]

shotgun willie sits around in his underwear  
bitin' on a bullet, pullin' out all of his hair  
a shotgun willie has got all of his family there  

well, you can't make a record if you ain't got nothin' to say  
you can't make a record if you ain't got nothin' to say  
you can't play music if you don't know nothin' to play  

a shotgun willie sits around in his underwear  
bitin' on a bullet, pullin' out all of his hair  
shotgun willie has got all of his family there  

well, john t floores was workin' with the klu klux klan  
the six foot five john t. was a hell of a man  
made a lot of money sellin' sheets on the family plan  

a shotgun willie sits around in his underwear  
bitin' on a bullet and pullin' out all of his hair  
a shotgun willie has got all of his family there

well, it was all 
that i could do to keep from crying' 
sometimes it seemed so useless to remain 
but you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' 
you never even call me by my name 
 
you don't have to call me waylon jennings 
and you don't have to call me charlie pride 
and you don't have to call me merle haggard anymore 
even though you're on my fighting' side 
 
and i'll hang around as long as you will let me 
and i never minded standing' in the rain 
but you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' 
you never even called me by my name 
 
well, i've heard my name 
a few times in your phone book (hello, hello) 
and i've seen it on signs where i've played 
but the only time i know 
i'll hear "david allan coe" 
is when jesus has his final judgment day 
 
and i'll hang around as long as you will let me 
and i never minded standing' in the rain 
but you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' 
you never even called me by my name 
 
well, a friend of mine named steve goodman wrote that song 
and he told me it was the perfect country & western song 
i wrote him back a letter and i told him it was  
not the perfect country & western song because he hadn't said anything at all about mama, 
or trains, 
or trucks, 
or prison,  
or getting' drunk 
well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song 
and he sent it to me,  
and after reading it, 
i realized that my friend had written the perfect 
country & western song 
and i felt obliged to include it on this album 
the last verse goes like this here 
 
well, i was drunk the day my mom got out of prison 
and i went to pick her up in the rain 
but before i could get to the station in my pickup truck 
she got run ned over by a damned old train 
 
and i'll hang around as long as you will let me 
and i never minded standing' in the rain 
no, a' you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' 
you never even call me 
well i wonder why you don't call me 
why don't you ever call me by my name

#### [ e _ 1 4 - 2 5]

i got a gal in cedartown, georgia  
i used to have to walk nearly three miles to court her  
she never had much, just a sharecropper's daughter  
but i married her and took her down to new orleans  
she got a little house in the south french quarter  

got a job tookin' bales load them on steamboat  
i give a seven days pay, next day i'm broke  
when she ain't a sleepin' all day she's a primpin'  
every evenin' when the sun goes down  
she starts a swarmin' on orleans town  

walkin' into work this mornin' at daybreak  
i caught her with the tall long dandy from canebrake  
she walked right by me and she looked right through me  
i made up my mind what i'm a gonna do  
eased in the pawnshop and bought a 22  

i watched as the room clerk gave them a room key  
a standin' right outside i could read room 23  
tonight i'll put her on a train for georgia  
gonna be a lotta kin folks squallin' and a grieving  
'cause that cedartown gal ain't breathing

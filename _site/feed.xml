        <title>all in alabama</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;i just had to show ‘em i didn’t need em&lt;br /&gt;
and so i headed out west to see some old friends of mine&lt;br /&gt;
i thought if i’d climb up ole ajax mountain&lt;br /&gt;
maybe that would help me get it all off my mind  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i made it up to the top, picked out a clear spot&lt;br /&gt;
i thought a whole lot about the rest of my life&lt;br /&gt;
i had no idea then soon it would nearly end up&lt;br /&gt;
on this mountainside i would nearly die  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and there all in alabama and there all in dixieland&lt;br /&gt;
god, i’m dying here in montana&lt;br /&gt;
please lord, just want to go back to hold her hand&lt;br /&gt;
just let me get back to my old homeland  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they said i’d never sing again&lt;br /&gt;
i learned a lot about my friends&lt;br /&gt;
‘cause when youre shot down and out&lt;br /&gt;
you don’t get many calls&lt;br /&gt;
but i saw some tears in some eyes&lt;br /&gt;
and soon my poor old mother would die&lt;br /&gt;
i nearly lost it all when i lost my grandpa  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but you could find us all in alabama&lt;br /&gt;
yeah, we’re all down in dixieland&lt;br /&gt;
i didn’t die out in montana&lt;br /&gt;
no, lord, you let me get back to my own homeland&lt;br /&gt;
and i’m gonna hold on to her hand  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i done a whole searching, a whole lot of hurtin’&lt;br /&gt;
before i finally found my road in life&lt;br /&gt;
you got to say things you want to say&lt;br /&gt;
go on and do things your own way&lt;br /&gt;
you can climb any old mountain&lt;br /&gt;
once you make up your mind  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and i made mine in alabama&lt;br /&gt;
and i found mine down in dixieland&lt;br /&gt;
i didn’t die out in montana&lt;br /&gt;
no, lord, you let me get back to my ole homeland&lt;br /&gt;
and i’m gonna hold on to her hand  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>cedartown georgia</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;e--1-4---2-5&quot;&gt;[ e _ 1 4 - 2 5]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i got a gal in cedartown, georgia&lt;br /&gt;
i used to have to walk nearly three miles to court her&lt;br /&gt;
she never had much, just a sharecropper’s daughter&lt;br /&gt;
but i married her and took her down to new orleans&lt;br /&gt;
she got a little house in the south french quarter  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;got a job tookin’ bales load them on steamboat&lt;br /&gt;
i give a seven days pay, next day i’m broke&lt;br /&gt;
when she ain’t a sleepin’ all day she’s a primpin’&lt;br /&gt;
every evenin’ when the sun goes down&lt;br /&gt;
she starts a swarmin’ on orleans town  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;walkin’ into work this mornin’ at daybreak&lt;br /&gt;
i caught her with the tall long dandy from canebrake&lt;br /&gt;
she walked right by me and she looked right through me&lt;br /&gt;
i made up my mind what i’m a gonna do&lt;br /&gt;
eased in the pawnshop and bought a 22  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i watched as the room clerk gave them a room key&lt;br /&gt;
a standin’ right outside i could read room 23&lt;br /&gt;
tonight i’ll put her on a train for georgia&lt;br /&gt;
gonna be a lotta kin folks squallin’ and a grieving&lt;br /&gt;
‘cause that cedartown gal ain’t breathing  &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;d--1-4-5-&quot;&gt;[ d _ 1 4 5 ]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;shotgun willie sits around in his underwear&lt;br /&gt;
bitin’ on a bullet, pullin’ out all of his hair&lt;br /&gt;
a shotgun willie has got all of his family there  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, you can’t make a record if you ain’t got nothin’ to say&lt;br /&gt;
you can’t make a record if you ain’t got nothin’ to say&lt;br /&gt;
you can’t play music if you don’t know nothin’ to play  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a shotgun willie sits around in his underwear&lt;br /&gt;
bitin’ on a bullet, pullin’ out all of his hair&lt;br /&gt;
shotgun willie has got all of his family there  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, john t floores was workin’ with the klu klux klan&lt;br /&gt;
the six foot five john t. was a hell of a man&lt;br /&gt;
made a lot of money sellin’ sheets on the family plan  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a shotgun willie sits around in his underwear&lt;br /&gt;
bitin’ on a bullet and pullin’ out all of his hair&lt;br /&gt;
a shotgun willie has got all of his family there  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>all in alabama</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;d--1-4-5-&quot;&gt;[ D _ 1 4 5 ]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just had to show ‘em i didn’t need em&lt;br /&gt;
and so i headed out west to see some old friends of mine&lt;br /&gt;
i thought if i’d climb up ole ajax mountain&lt;br /&gt;
maybe that would help me get it all off my mind  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i made it up to the top, picked out a clear spot&lt;br /&gt;
i thought a whole lot about the rest of my life&lt;br /&gt;
i had no idea then soon it would nearly end up&lt;br /&gt;
on this mountainside i would nearly die  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and there all in alabama and there all in dixieland&lt;br /&gt;
god, i’m dying here in montana&lt;br /&gt;
please lord, just want to go back to hold her hand&lt;br /&gt;
just let me get back to my old homeland  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they said i’d never sing again&lt;br /&gt;
i learned a lot about my friends&lt;br /&gt;
‘cause when youre shot down and out&lt;br /&gt;
you don’t get many calls&lt;br /&gt;
but i saw some tears in some eyes&lt;br /&gt;
and soon my poor old mother would die&lt;br /&gt;
i nearly lost it all when i lost my grandpa  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but you could find us all in alabama&lt;br /&gt;
yeah, we’re all down in dixieland&lt;br /&gt;
i didn’t die out in montana&lt;br /&gt;
no, lord, you let me get back to my own homeland&lt;br /&gt;
and i’m gonna hold on to her hand  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i done a whole searching, a whole lot of hurtin’&lt;br /&gt;
before i finally found my road in life&lt;br /&gt;
you got to say things you want to say&lt;br /&gt;
go on and do things your own way&lt;br /&gt;
you can climb any old mountain&lt;br /&gt;
once you make up your mind  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and i made mine in alabama&lt;br /&gt;
and i found mine down in dixieland&lt;br /&gt;
i didn’t die out in montana&lt;br /&gt;
no, lord, you let me get back to my ole homeland&lt;br /&gt;
and i’m gonna hold on to her hand  &lt;/p&gt;
